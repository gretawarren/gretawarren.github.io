Hi! I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science, and [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/), University College Dublin. 
I am supervised by [Prof. Mark Keane](https://people.ucd.ie/mark.keane) and [Prof. Ruth Byrne](https://reasoningandimagination.com/).
My primary research interests are in eXplainable AI (XAI), explanatory reasoning, counterfactual thinking and human-AI interaction.

My doctoral research examines the efficacy of counterfactual explanations in explainable AI, and aims to develop an approach to explaining AI system decisions grounded in psychological evidence and centred on the needs of their users.

### Some more about me

I have a B.A. (Hons) in Psychology from [Trinity College Dublin](https://psychology.tcd.ie/about/), and I worked as a research assistant in a neuroscience lab for a year prior to beginning my PhD. 
I was born in Sydney, Australia, but grew up in a small village on the west coast of Ireland. I completed my primary and secondary level education in [Irish (Gaeilge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language), the native and official language of Ireland, which is spoken by [over 600,000 people every day](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpsr/censusofpopulation2022-summaryresults/educationandirishlanguage/).
