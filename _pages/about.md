Hi! I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science, and Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin. 
I am supervised by Prof. Mark Keane and Prof. Ruth Byrne.
My primary research interests are in eXplainable AI (XAI), explanatory reasoning, counterfactual thinking and human-AI interaction.

My doctoral research examines the efficacy of counterfactual explanations in explainable AI, and aims to develop approaches to explaining AI system decisions that are grounded in psychological evidence and centred on the needs of their users.

About me
I have a B.A. (Hons) in Psychology from Trinity College Dublin, and I worked as a research assistant in a neuroscience lab for a year prior to beginning my PhD. I was born in Sydney, Australia, but grew up in a small village on the west coast of Ireland. I completed my primary and secondary level education in Irish (Gaeilge), the native and official language of Ireland, which is spoken by about XXXX people every day.
