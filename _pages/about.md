### About me

I'm a Postdoc in the [CopeNLU](https://www.copenlu.com/) group at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). I work with [Prof. Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/) and [Prof. Irina Shklovski](https://miswritings.org/) on the ERC-funded ExplainYourself project, researching human-centred explanations for automated fact-checking.

My research is interdisciplinary and draws from cognitive psychology, computer science and human-computer interaction.
My primary research interests are in **eXplainable AI (XAI)**, **human-AI interaction**, **fact-checking** and **explanatory reasoning**.

I completed my PhD in the School of Computer Science and [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/), University College Dublin, supervised by [Prof. Mark Keane](https://people.ucd.ie/mark.keane) and [Prof. Ruth Byrne](https://reasoningandimagination.com/).
My doctoral research examined the efficacy of counterfactual explanations in explainable AI, taking a human-centred approach to explaining AI system decisions grounded in cognitive psychology.

I hold a B.A. (Hons) in Psychology from [Trinity College Dublin](https://psychology.tcd.ie/about/), and I worked as a research assistant in [Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience](https://www.tcd.ie/Neuroscience/research/) prior to beginning my PhD. 
I also speak [Irish (Gaeilge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language), the native and official language of Ireland (along with [almost 2 million other people](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpsr/censusofpopulation2022-summaryresults/educationandirishlanguage/)!).
